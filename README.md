# Avalam board game

## What is it?

Ongoing school programming project consisting of creating an Avalam board game.
It's there mainly to get me used to working with git.

## Compilation

- To compile and run the game binary :
```bash
make avalam
./bin/avalam
```

- To compile and run the tests :
```bash
make test
./test/test
```

- To remove the object files produced during compilation :
```bash
make clean
```

## Status

Working version. There is still work to be done to have a real game but it's
good enough to play, load and save a game.
